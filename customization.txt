49.1 Easy Customization Interface
=================================

Emacs has many “settings” which you can change.  Most settings are
“customizable variables” (*note Variables::), which are also called
“user options”.  There is a huge number of customizable variables,
controlling numerous aspects of Emacs behavior; the variables documented
in this manual are listed in *note Variable Index::.  A separate class
of settings are the “faces”, which determine the fonts, colors, and
other attributes of text (*note Faces::).

   To browse and alter settings (both variables and faces), type ‘M-x
customize’.  This creates a “customization buffer”, which lets you
navigate through a logically organized list of settings, edit and set
their values, and save them permanently.

* Menu:

* Customization Groups::     How settings are classified.
* Browsing Custom::          Browsing and searching for settings.
* Changing a Variable::      How to edit an option’s value and set the option.
* Saving Customizations::    Saving customizations for future Emacs sessions.
* Face Customization::       How to edit the attributes of a face.
* Specific Customization::   Customizing specific settings or groups.
* Custom Themes::            Collections of customization settings.
* Creating Custom Themes::   How to create a new custom theme.
