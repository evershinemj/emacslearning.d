read-only-mode is an interactive compiled Lisp function in
‘simple.el’.

It is bound to C-x C-q.

(read-only-mode &optional ARG)

Change whether the current buffer is read-only.
With prefix argument ARG, make the buffer read-only if ARG is
positive, otherwise make it writable.  If buffer is read-only
and ‘view-read-only’ is non-nil, enter view mode.

Do not call this from a Lisp program unless you really intend to
do the same thing as the C-x C-q command, including
possibly enabling or disabling View mode.  Also, note that this
command works by setting the variable ‘buffer-read-only’, which
does not affect read-only regions caused by text properties.  To
ignore read-only status in a Lisp program (whether due to text
properties or buffer state), bind ‘inhibit-read-only’ temporarily
to a non-nil value.
