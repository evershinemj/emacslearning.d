repositon point
‘M-r’
     Without moving the text on the screen, reposition point on the left
     margin of the center-most text line of the window; on subsequent
     consecutive invocations, move point to the left margin of the
     top-most line, the bottom-most line, and so forth, in cyclic order
     (‘move-to-window-line-top-bottom’).

     A numeric argument says which screen line to place point on,
     counting downward from the top of the window (zero means the top
     line).  A negative argument counts lines up from the bottom (−1
     means the bottom line).  See Arguments, for more information on
     numeric arguments.
