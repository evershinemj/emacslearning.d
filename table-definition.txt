25.15.1 What is a Text-based Table?
-----------------------------------

A “table” consists of a rectangular text area which is divided into
“cells”.  Each cell must be at least one character wide and one
character high, not counting its border lines.  A cell can be subdivided
into more cells, but they cannot overlap.

   Cell border lines are drawn with three special characters, specified
by the following variables:

‘table-cell-vertical-char’
     The character used for vertical lines.  The default is ‘|’.

‘table-cell-horizontal-chars’
     The characters used for horizontal lines.  The default is ‘"-="’.

‘table-cell-intersection-char’
     The character used for the intersection of horizontal and vertical
     lines.  The default is ‘+’.

The following are examples of _invalid_ tables:

        +-----+       +--+    +-++--+
        |     |       |  |    | ||  |
        |     |       |  |    | ||  |
        +--+  |    +--+--+    +-++--+
        |  |  |    |  |  |    +-++--+
        |  |  |    |  |  |    | ||  |
        +--+--+    +--+--+    +-++--+
           a          b          c

From left to right:

  a. Overlapped cells or non-rectangular cells are not allowed.
  b. The border must be rectangular.
  c. Cells must have a minimum width/height of one character.
