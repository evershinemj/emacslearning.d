7.11 Repeating a Command
========================

Many simple commands, such as those invoked with a single key or with
‘M-x COMMAND-NAME <RET>’, can be repeated by invoking them with a
numeric argument that serves as a repeat count (see Arguments).
However, if the command you want to repeat prompts for input, or uses a
numeric argument in another way, that method won’t work.

   The command ‘C-x z’ (‘repeat’) provides another way to repeat an
Emacs command many times.  This command repeats the previous Emacs
command, whatever that was.  Repeating a command uses the same arguments
that were used before; it does not read new arguments each time.

   To repeat the command more than once, type additional ‘z’’s: each ‘z’
repeats the command one more time.  Repetition ends when you type a
character other than ‘z’ or press a mouse button.

   For example, suppose you type ‘C-u 2 0 C-d’ to delete 20 characters.
You can repeat that command (including its argument) three additional
times, to delete a total of 80 characters, by typing ‘C-x z z z’.  The
first ‘C-x z’ repeats the command once, and each subsequent ‘z’ repeats
it once again.
