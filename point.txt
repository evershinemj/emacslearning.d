1.1 Point
=========

The cursor in the selected window shows the location where most editing
commands take effect, which is called “point”(1).  Many Emacs commands
move point to different places in the buffer; for example, you can place
point by clicking mouse button 1 (normally the left button) at the
desired location.

   By default, the cursor in the selected window is drawn as a solid
block and appears to be _on_ a character, but you should think of point
as _between_ two characters; it is situated _before_ the character under
the cursor.  For example, if your text looks like ‘frob’ with the cursor
over the ‘b’, then point is between the ‘o’ and the ‘b’.  If you insert
the character ‘!’ at that position, the result is ‘fro!b’, with point
between the ‘!’ and the ‘b’.  Thus, the cursor remains over the ‘b’, as
before.

   If you are editing several files in Emacs, each in its own buffer,
each buffer has its own value of point.  A buffer that is not currently
displayed remembers its value of point if you later display it again.
Furthermore, if a buffer is displayed in multiple windows, each of those
windows has its own value of point.

   See Cursor Display, for options that control how Emacs displays
the cursor.

   (1) The term “point” comes from the character ‘.’, which was the
command in TECO (the language in which the original Emacs was written)
for accessing the editing position.
