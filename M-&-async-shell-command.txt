M-& runs the command async-shell-command (found in global-map), which
is an interactive compiled Lisp function in ‘simple.el’.

It is bound to M-&.

(async-shell-command COMMAND &optional OUTPUT-BUFFER ERROR-BUFFER)

Execute string COMMAND asynchronously in background.

Like ‘shell-command’, but adds ‘&’ at the end of COMMAND
to execute it asynchronously.

The output appears in the buffer ‘*Async Shell Command*’.
That buffer is in shell mode.

You can configure ‘async-shell-command-buffer’ to specify what to do
when the ‘*Async Shell Command*’ buffer is already taken by another
running shell command.  To run COMMAND without displaying the output
in a window you can configure ‘display-buffer-alist’ to use the action
‘display-buffer-no-window’ for the buffer ‘*Async Shell Command*’.

In Elisp, you will often be better served by calling ‘start-process’
directly, since it offers more control and does not impose the use of
a shell (with its need to quote arguments).
