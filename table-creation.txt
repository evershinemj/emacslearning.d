25.15.2 Creating a Table
------------------------

To create a text-based table from scratch, type ‘M-x table-insert’.
This command prompts for the number of table columns, the number of
table rows, cell width and cell height.  The cell width and cell height
do not include the cell borders; each can be specified as a single
integer (which means each cell is given the same width/height), or as a
sequence of integers separated by spaces or commas (which specify the
width/height of the individual table columns/rows, counting from left to
right for table columns and from top to bottom for table rows).  The
specified table is then inserted at point.

   The table inserted by ‘M-x table-insert’ contains special text
properties, which tell Emacs to treat it specially as a text-based
table.  If you save the buffer to a file and visit it again later, those
properties are lost, and the table appears to Emacs as an ordinary piece
of text.  See the next section, for how to convert it back into a table.
