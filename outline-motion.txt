25.9.2 Outline Motion Commands
------------------------------

Outline mode provides special motion commands that move backward and
forward to heading lines.

‘C-c C-n’
     Move point to the next visible heading line
     (‘outline-next-visible-heading’).
‘C-c C-p’
     Move point to the previous visible heading line
     (‘outline-previous-visible-heading’).
‘C-c C-f’
     Move point to the next visible heading line at the same level as
     the one point is on (‘outline-forward-same-level’).
‘C-c C-b’
     Move point to the previous visible heading line at the same level
     (‘outline-backward-same-level’).
‘C-c C-u’
     Move point up to a lower-level (more inclusive) visible heading
     line (‘outline-up-heading’).

   All of the above commands accept numeric arguments as repeat counts.
For example, ‘C-c C-f’, when given an argument, moves forward that many
visible heading lines on the same level, and ‘C-c C-u’ with an argument
moves out of that many nested levels.
