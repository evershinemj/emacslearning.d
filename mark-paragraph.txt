   When you wish to operate on a paragraph, type ‘M-h’
(‘mark-paragraph’) to set the region around it.  For example, ‘M-h C-w’
kills the paragraph around or after point.  ‘M-h’ puts point at the
beginning and mark at the end of the paragraph point was in.  If point
is between paragraphs (in a run of blank lines, or at a boundary), ‘M-h’
sets the region around the paragraph following point.  If there are
blank lines preceding the first line of the paragraph, one of these
blank lines is included in the region.  If the region is already active,
the command sets the mark without changing point, and each subsequent
‘M-h’ further advances the mark by one paragraph.
