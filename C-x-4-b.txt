C-x 4 b runs the command switch-to-buffer-other-window (found in
global-map), which is an interactive compiled Lisp function in
‘window.el’.

It is bound to C-x 4 b.

(switch-to-buffer-other-window BUFFER-OR-NAME &optional NORECORD)

Select the buffer specified by BUFFER-OR-NAME in another window.
BUFFER-OR-NAME may be a buffer, a string (a buffer name), or
nil.  Return the buffer switched to.

If called interactively, read the buffer name using ‘read-buffer’.
The variable ‘confirm-nonexistent-file-or-buffer’ determines
whether to request confirmation before creating a new buffer.
See ‘read-buffer’ for features related to input and completion
of buffer names.

If BUFFER-OR-NAME is a string and does not identify an existing
buffer, create a new buffer with that name.  If BUFFER-OR-NAME is
nil, switch to the buffer returned by ‘other-buffer’.

Optional second argument NORECORD non-nil means do not put this
buffer at the front of the list of recently selected ones.

This uses the function ‘display-buffer’ as a subroutine; see its
documentation for additional customization information.
