25.9.3 Outline Visibility Commands
----------------------------------

Outline mode provides several commands for temporarily hiding or
revealing parts of the buffer, based on the outline structure.  These
commands are not undoable; their effects are simply not recorded by the
undo mechanism, so you can undo right past them (*note Undo::).

   Many of these commands act on the current heading line.  If point is
on a heading line, that is the current heading line; if point is on a
body line, the current heading line is the nearest preceding header
line.

‘C-c C-c’
     Make the current heading line’s body invisible
     (‘outline-hide-entry’).
‘C-c C-e’
     Make the current heading line’s body visible
     (‘outline-show-entry’).
‘C-c C-d’
     Make everything under the current heading invisible, not including
     the heading itself (‘outline-hide-subtree’).
‘C-c C-s’
     Make everything under the current heading visible, including body,
     subheadings, and their bodies (‘outline-show-subtree’).
‘C-c C-l’
     Make the body of the current heading line, and of all its
     subheadings, invisible (‘outline-hide-leaves’).
‘C-c C-k’
     Make all subheadings of the current heading line, at all levels,
     visible (‘outline-show-branches’).
‘C-c C-i’
     Make immediate subheadings (one level down) of the current heading
     line visible (‘outline-show-children’).
‘C-c C-t’
     Make all body lines in the buffer invisible (‘outline-hide-body’).
‘C-c C-a’
     Make all lines in the buffer visible (‘outline-show-all’).
‘C-c C-q’
     Hide everything except the top N levels of heading lines
     (‘outline-hide-sublevels’).
‘C-c C-o’
     Hide everything except for the heading or body that point is in,
     plus the headings leading up from there to the top level of the
     outline (‘outline-hide-other’).

   The simplest of these commands are ‘C-c C-c’ (‘outline-hide-entry’),
which hides the body lines directly following the current heading line,
and ‘C-c C-e’ (‘outline-show-entry’), which reveals them.  Subheadings
and their bodies are not affected.

   The commands ‘C-c C-d’ (‘outline-hide-subtree’) and ‘C-c C-s’
(‘outline-show-subtree’) are more powerful.  They apply to the current
heading line’s “subtree”: its body, all of its subheadings, both direct
and indirect, and all of their bodies.

   The command ‘C-c C-l’ (‘outline-hide-leaves’) hides the body of the
current heading line as well as all the bodies in its subtree; the
subheadings themselves are left visible.  The command ‘C-c C-k’
(‘outline-show-branches’) reveals the subheadings, if they had
previously been hidden (e.g., by ‘C-c C-d’).  The command ‘C-c C-i’
(‘outline-show-children’) is a weaker version of this; it reveals just
the direct subheadings, i.e., those one level down.

   The command ‘C-c C-o’ (‘outline-hide-other’) hides everything except
the entry that point is in, plus its parents (the headers leading up
from there to top level in the outline) and the top level headings.  It
also reveals body lines preceding the first heading in the buffer.

   The remaining commands affect the whole buffer.  ‘C-c C-t’
(‘outline-hide-body’) makes all body lines invisible, so that you see
just the outline structure (as a special exception, it will not hide
lines at the top of the file, preceding the first header line, even
though these are technically body lines).  ‘C-c C-a’
(‘outline-show-all’) makes all lines visible.  ‘C-c C-q’
(‘outline-hide-sublevels’) hides all but the top level headings at and
above the level of the current heading line (defaulting to 1 if point is
not on a heading); with a numeric argument N, it hides everything except
the top N levels of heading lines.  Note that it completely reveals all
the N top levels and the body lines before the first heading.

   When incremental search finds text that is hidden by Outline mode, it
makes that part of the buffer visible.  If you exit the search at that
position, the text remains visible.  To toggle whether or not an active
incremental search can match hidden text, type ‘M-s i’.  To change the
default for future searches, customize the option ‘search-invisible’.
(This option also affects how ‘query-replace’ and related functions
treat hidden text, *note Query Replace::.)  You can also automatically
make text visible as you navigate in it by using Reveal mode (‘M-x
reveal-mode’), a buffer-local minor mode.
