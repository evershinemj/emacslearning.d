   The definition of a paragraph depends on the major mode.  In
Fundamental mode, as well as Text mode and related modes, a paragraph is
separated from neighboring paragraphs by one or more “blank lines”—lines
that are either empty, or consist solely of space, tab and/or formfeed
characters.  In programming language modes, paragraphs are usually
defined in a similar way, so that you can use the paragraph commands
even though there are no paragraphs as such in a program.
