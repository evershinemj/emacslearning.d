15.2 Nonincremental Search
==========================

Emacs also has conventional nonincremental search commands, which
require you to type the entire search string before searching begins.

‘C-s <RET> STRING <RET>’
     Search for STRING.
‘C-r <RET> STRING <RET>’
     Search backward for STRING.

   To start a nonincremental search, first type ‘C-s <RET>’.  This
enters the minibuffer to read the search string; terminate the string
with <RET>, and then the search takes place.  If the string is not
found, the search command signals an error.

   When you type ‘C-s <RET>’, the ‘C-s’ invokes incremental search as
usual.  That command is specially programmed to invoke the command for
nonincremental search, if the string you specify is empty.  (Such an
empty argument would otherwise be useless.)  ‘C-r <RET>’ does likewise,
invoking the nonincremental backward-searching command.

   Nonincremental search can also be invoked from the menu bar’s
‘Edit->Search’ menu.

   You can also use two simpler commands, ‘M-x search-forward’ and ‘M-x
search-backward’.  These commands look for the literal strings you
specify, and don’t support any of the lax-search features (see Lax
Search) except case folding.
