C-h b runs the command describe-bindings (found in global-map), which
is an interactive compiled Lisp function in ‘help.el’.

It is bound to C-h b, <f1> b, <help> b, <menu-bar> <help-menu>
<describe> <list-keybindings>.

(describe-bindings &optional PREFIX BUFFER)

Display a buffer showing a list of all defined keys, and their definitions.
The keys are displayed in order of precedence.

The optional argument PREFIX, if non-nil, should be a key sequence;
then we display only bindings that start with that prefix.
The optional argument BUFFER specifies which buffer’s bindings
to display (default, the current buffer).  BUFFER can be a buffer
or a buffer name.
