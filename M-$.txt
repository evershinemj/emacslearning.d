M-$ runs the command ispell-word (found in global-map), which is an
interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in ‘ispell.el’.

It is bound to M-$, <menu-bar> <edit> <spell> <ispell-word>,
<menu-bar> <tools> <spell> <ispell-word>.

(ispell-word &optional FOLLOWING QUIETLY CONTINUE REGION)

Check spelling of word under or before the cursor.
If the word is not found in dictionary, display possible corrections
in a window allowing you to choose one.

If optional argument FOLLOWING is non-nil or if ‘ispell-following-word’
is non-nil when called interactively, then the following word
(rather than preceding) is checked when the cursor is not over a word.
When the optional argument QUIETLY is non-nil or ‘ispell-quietly’ is non-nil
when called interactively, non-corrective messages are suppressed.

With a prefix argument (or if CONTINUE is non-nil),
resume interrupted spell-checking of a buffer or region.

Interactively, in Transient Mark mode when the mark is active, call
‘ispell-region’ to check the active region for spelling errors.

Word syntax is controlled by the definition of the chosen dictionary,
which is in ‘ispell-local-dictionary-alist’ or ‘ispell-dictionary-alist’.

This will check or reload the dictionary.  Use M-x ispell-change-dictionary
or M-x ispell-region to update the Ispell process.

Return values:
nil           word is correct or spelling is accepted.
0             word is inserted into buffer-local definitions.
"word"        word corrected from word list.
("word" arg)  word is hand entered.
quit          spell session exited.
