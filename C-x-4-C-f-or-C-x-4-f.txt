C-x 4 C-f runs the command find-file-other-window (found in
global-map), which is an interactive compiled Lisp function in
‘files.el’.

It is bound to C-x 4 C-f, C-x 4 f.

(find-file-other-window FILENAME &optional WILDCARDS)

Edit file FILENAME, in another window.

Like C-x C-f (which see), but creates a new window or reuses
an existing one.  See the function ‘display-buffer’.

Interactively, the default if you just type RET is the current directory,
but the visited file name is available through the minibuffer history:
type M-x next-history-element to pull it into the minibuffer.

The first time M-x next-history-element is used after Emacs prompts for
the file name, the result is affected by ‘file-name-at-point-functions’,
which by default try to guess the file name by looking at point in the
current buffer.  Customize the value of ‘file-name-at-point-functions’
or set it to nil, if you want only the visited file name and the
current directory to be available on first M-x next-history-element
request.

Interactively, or if WILDCARDS is non-nil in a call from Lisp,
expand wildcards (if any) and visit multiple files.
