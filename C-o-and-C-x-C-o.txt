7.7 Blank Lines
===============

Here are special commands and techniques for inserting and deleting
blank lines.

‘C-o’
     Insert a blank line after the cursor (‘open-line’).
‘C-x C-o’
     Delete all but one of many consecutive blank lines
     (‘delete-blank-lines’).

   We have seen how ‘<RET>’ (‘newline’) starts a new line of text.
However, it may be easier to see what you are doing if you first make a
blank line and then insert the desired text into it.  This is easy to do
using the key ‘C-o’ (‘open-line’), which inserts a newline after point
but leaves point in front of the newline.  After ‘C-o’, type the text
for the new line.

   You can make several blank lines by typing ‘C-o’ several times, or by
giving it a numeric argument specifying how many blank lines to make.
See Arguments, for how.  If you have a fill prefix, the ‘C-o’
command inserts the fill prefix on the new line, if typed at the
beginning of a line.  See Fill Prefix.

   The easy way to get rid of extra blank lines is with the command ‘C-x                                                                                      
C-o’ (‘delete-blank-lines’).  If point lies within a run of several
blank lines, ‘C-x C-o’ deletes all but one of them.  If point is on a
single blank line, ‘C-x C-o’ deletes it.  If point is on a nonblank
line, ‘C-x C-o’ deletes all following blank lines, if any exists.
