23 Major and Minor Modes
************************

Emacs contains many “editing modes” that alter its basic behavior in
useful ways.  These are divided into “major modes” and “minor modes”.

   Major modes provide specialized facilities for working on a
particular file type, such as a C source file (*note Programs::), or a
particular type of non-file buffer, such as a shell buffer (*note
Shell::).  Major modes are mutually exclusive; each buffer has one and
only one major mode at any time.

   Minor modes are optional features which you can turn on or off, not
necessarily specific to a type of file or buffer.  For example, Auto
Fill mode is a minor mode in which <SPC> breaks lines between words as
you type (*note Auto Fill::).  Minor modes are independent of one
another, and of the selected major mode.
