C-x s runs the command save-some-buffers (found in global-map), which
is an interactive compiled Lisp function in ‘files.el’.

It is bound to C-x s.

(save-some-buffers &optional ARG PRED)

Save some modified file-visiting buffers.  Asks user about each one.
You can answer ‘y’ to save, ‘n’ not to save, ‘C-r’ to look at the
buffer in question with ‘view-buffer’ before deciding or ‘d’ to
view the differences using ‘diff-buffer-with-file’.

This command first saves any buffers where ‘buffer-save-without-query’ is
non-nil, without asking.

Optional argument ARG (interactively, prefix argument) non-nil means save
all with no questions.
Optional second argument PRED determines which buffers are considered:
If PRED is nil, all the file-visiting buffers are considered.
If PRED is t, then certain non-file buffers will also be considered.
If PRED is a zero-argument function, it indicates for each buffer whether
to consider it or not when called with that buffer current.
PRED defaults to the value of ‘save-some-buffers-default-predicate’.

See ‘save-some-buffers-action-alist’ if you want to
change the additional actions you can take on files.
