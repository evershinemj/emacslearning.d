   You can use a numeric argument before a self-inserting character to
insert multiple copies of it.  This is straightforward when the
character is not a digit; for example, ‘C-u 6 4 a’ inserts 64 copies of
the character ‘a’.  But this does not work for inserting digits;
‘C-u 6 4 1’ specifies an argument of 641.  You can separate the argument
from the digit to insert with another ‘C-u’; for example,
‘C-u 6 4 C-u 1’ does insert 64 copies of the character ‘1’.
