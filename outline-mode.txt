25.9 Outline Mode
=================

Outline mode is a major mode derived from Text mode, which is
specialized for editing outlines.  It provides commands to navigate
between entries in the outline structure, and commands to make parts of
a buffer temporarily invisible, so that the outline structure may be
more easily viewed.  Type ‘M-x outline-mode’ to switch to Outline mode.
Entering Outline mode runs the hook ‘text-mode-hook’ followed by the
hook ‘outline-mode-hook’ (*note Hooks::).

   When you use an Outline mode command to make a line invisible (*note
Outline Visibility::), the line disappears from the screen.  An ellipsis
(three periods in a row) is displayed at the end of the previous visible
line, to indicate the hidden text.  Multiple consecutive invisible lines
produce just one ellipsis.

   Editing commands that operate on lines, such as ‘C-n’ and ‘C-p’,
treat the text of the invisible line as part of the previous visible
line.  Killing the ellipsis at the end of a visible line really kills
all the following invisible text associated with the ellipsis.

   Outline minor mode is a buffer-local minor mode which provides the
same commands as the major mode, Outline mode, but can be used in
conjunction with other major modes.  You can type ‘M-x
outline-minor-mode’ to toggle Outline minor mode in the current buffer,
or use a file-local variable setting to enable it in a specific file
(*note File Variables::).

   The major mode, Outline mode, provides special key bindings on the
‘C-c’ prefix.  Outline minor mode provides similar bindings with ‘C-c @’
as the prefix; this is to reduce the conflicts with the major mode’s
special commands.  (The variable ‘outline-minor-mode-prefix’ controls
the prefix used.)
