11.3 Operating on the Region
============================

Once you have a region, here are some of the ways you can operate on it:

   • Kill it with ‘C-w’ (see Killing).
   • Copy it to the kill ring with ‘M-w’ (see Yanking).
   • Convert case with ‘C-x C-l’ or ‘C-x C-u’ (see Case).
   • Undo changes within it using ‘C-u C-/’ (see Undo).
   • Replace text within it using ‘M-%’ (see Query Replace).
   • Indent it with ‘C-x <TAB>’ or ‘C-M-\’ (see Indentation).
   • Fill it as text with ‘M-x fill-region’ (see Filling).
   • Check the spelling of words within it with ‘M-$’ (see
     Spelling).
   • Evaluate it as Lisp code with ‘M-x eval-region’ (see Lisp
     Eval).
   • Save it in a register with ‘C-x r s’ (see Registers).
   • Save it in a buffer or a file (see Accumulating Text).
