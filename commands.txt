Every Emacs command has a name that you can use to run it.  For
convenience, many commands also have key bindings.  You can run those
commands by typing the keys, or run them by name.  Most Emacs commands
have no key bindings, so the only way to run them is by name.  (*Note
Key Bindings::, for how to set up key bindings.)

   By convention, a command name consists of one or more words,
separated by hyphens; for example, ‘auto-fill-mode’ or ‘manual-entry’.
Command names mostly use complete English words to make them easier to
remember.

   To run a command by name, start with ‘M-x’, type the command name,
then terminate it with <RET>.  ‘M-x’ uses the minibuffer to read the
command name.  The string ‘M-x’ appears at the beginning of the
minibuffer as a “prompt” to remind you to enter a command name to be
run.  <RET> exits the minibuffer and runs the command.  *Note
Minibuffer::, for more information on the minibuffer.

   You can use completion to enter the command name.  For example, to
invoke the command ‘forward-char’, you can type

     M-x forward-char <RET>

or

     M-x forw <TAB> c <RET>

Note that ‘forward-char’ is the same command that you invoke with the
key ‘C-f’.  The existence of a key binding does not stop you from
running the command by name.
