   A table is re-aligned automatically each time you press <TAB> or
<RET> or ‘C-c C-c’ inside the table.  <TAB> also moves to the next field
(<RET> to the next row) and creates new table rows at the end of the
table or before horizontal lines.  The indentation of the table is set
by the first line.  Any line starting with ‘|-’ is considered as a
horizontal separator line and will be expanded on the next re-align to
span the whole table width.  So, to create the above table, you would
only type

     |Name|Phone|Age|
     |-

and then press <TAB> to align the table and start filling in fields.
Even faster would be to type ‘|Name|Phone|Age’ followed by ‘C-c <RET>’.
