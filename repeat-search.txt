Suppose you search forward for ‘FOO’ and find a match, but not the one
you expected to find: the ‘FOO’ you were aiming for occurs later in the
buffer.  In this event, type another ‘C-s’ to move to the next
occurrence of the search string.  You can repeat this any number of
times.  If you overshoot, you can cancel some ‘C-s’ characters with
<DEL>.  Similarly, each ‘C-r’ in a backward incremental search repeats
the backward search.
