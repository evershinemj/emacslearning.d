12.4 Accumulating Text
======================

Usually we copy or move text by killing it and yanking it, but there are
other convenient methods for copying one block of text in many places,
or for copying many scattered blocks of text into one place.  Here we
describe the commands to accumulate scattered pieces of text into a
buffer or into a file.

‘M-x append-to-buffer’
     Append region to the contents of a specified buffer.
‘M-x prepend-to-buffer’
     Prepend region to the contents of a specified buffer.
‘M-x copy-to-buffer’
     Copy region into a specified buffer, deleting that buffer’s old
     contents.
‘M-x insert-buffer’
     Insert the contents of a specified buffer into current buffer at
     point.
‘M-x append-to-file’
     Append region to the contents of a specified file, at the end.
