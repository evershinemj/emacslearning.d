‘M-<’
     Move to the top of the buffer (‘beginning-of-buffer’).  With
     numeric argument N, move to N/10 of the way from the top.  On
     graphical displays, ‘C-<HOME>’ does the same.

‘M->’
     Move to the end of the buffer (‘end-of-buffer’).  On graphical
     displays, ‘C-<END>’ does the same.
