‘C-c |     (org-table-create-or-convert-from-region)’
     Convert the active region to a table.  If every line contains at
     least one TAB character, the function assumes that the material is
     tab separated.  If every line contains a comma, comma-separated
     values (CSV) are assumed.  If not, lines are split at whitespace
     into fields.  You can use a prefix argument to force a specific
     separator: ‘C-u’ forces CSV, ‘C-u C-u’ forces TAB, ‘C-u C-u C-u’
     will prompt for a regular expression to match the separator, and a
     numeric argument N indicates that at least N consecutive spaces, or
     alternatively a TAB will be the separator.
     If there is no active region, this command creates an empty Org
     table.  But it is easier just to start typing, like
     ‘|Name|Phone|Age <RET> |- <TAB>’.
